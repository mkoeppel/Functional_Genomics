It contains the necessary steps to process NGS data derived from a typical functional genomics experiment:

The data used was generated in my lab at the DSMZ-Leibniz-Institut and is, so far, unpublished. Therefore, the raw-data has not yet been deposited to any nucleic acid archive. Provided is a form of pre-processed data, which is small enough to be distributed with the repo. All pre-processing steps are documented below and are standard first level analysis of NGS-data, that is quality-control and mapping/ counting to a reference genome.


Following sequencing and fastq generation,
demultiplexing: bcl2fastq (v2.17.1.14, Illumina)
trimming: fastq-mcf (ea-utils 1.04.807)
quality control: FastQC (v0.11.5)
alignment: STAR (2.5.3a) to the Gencode Homo sapiens genome (v26)
conversion to BAM / sorting: samtools (1.9)
expression analysis: HTSeq-count python script (0.8.0)


A typical research question for such an experiment would be:
Which genes are directly regulated by a particular transcription factor?
  - This requires knowledge about those genes that change their expression, when the abundance of this particular transcription factor is changed (typically via siRNA-knockdown or overexpression; here it is a knockdown).
  - As genes can also change their expression due to indirect/ secondary effects, binding sites of the transcription factor within the genomic sequences also need to be identified and assigned to target genes.
In combination these two experiements allow the prediction of direct, real target genes with high probability.

As a factor, the Myocyte Enhancer Factor 2D (MEF2D) was examined. It is a transcription factor that is originally involved in the differentiation of muscle cells. However different mutations, usually involving some kind of translocation, cause it to act as an oncogene involved in the onset of different forms of leukemia.
The cellular system used to examine the behaviour of this factor was the acute myeloid leukemia cell line OCI-AML3, as it has high mRNA levels and also clearly detectable protein-levels of this factor.

1. load all necessary packages

```{r}
library(tidyverse) # package for data wrangling and data visualization
library(DESeq2) # package for analysis of differential expresion
library("org.Hs.eg.db") # package to annotate genes
library(ChIPseeker) # package to annotate ChIP-seq peaks
library(TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg38.knownGene) # another annotation package to assign genes to genomic regions
library(clusterProfiler) # package to assign funcitonal enrichmets to sets of genes
library(chipenrich)
library(ReactomePA)

###for individual peak Files
library(Gviz)
library(GenomicInteractions)
library(rtracklayer)
#library(DOSE)
```

2. define path to and read data-files for RNA-seq and ChIP-seq data
generates a table of RNA-seq data from the 3 replicates of control and the 3 replicates of knockdown samples
also reads the genomic binding sites identified by ChIP-seq and predicted using MACS2 from within the GALAXY-suite

```{r}
directory = "./data/rna_seq_counts/24h"
sampleFiles = grep("counts",
                   list.files(directory),
                   value=TRUE)
sampleCondition = substr(sampleFiles, 8,14)
sampleTable = data.frame(sampleName=sampleFiles,
                          fileName=sampleFiles,
                          experiment=sampleFiles,
                          condition=sampleCondition)

mef2d = readPeakFile("./data/Galaxy_MACS2_MEF2D_OA_repl_q005_dupAll.bed")

```

3. analysis of differential expression
```{r}
ddsHTSeq = DESeqDataSetFromHTSeqCount(sampleTable=sampleTable,
                                       directory=directory,
                                       design= ~ condition)
ddsHTSeq

keep = rowSums(counts(ddsHTSeq)) >= 10
ddsHTSeq = ddsHTSeq[keep,]
```

4. calculation of significantly changing genes, candidates are sorted by p-value and a p-value cut-off < 0.1 is chosen
(although this is a rather high p-value, so not very significant, the designed experiment with a knockdown instead of a knockout can be expected to have less drastic effects and to keep a rather large set of output-genes for the next steps a less stringent p-value is preferred)
```{r}
# instead of the summarizing DESeq-function individual steps can also be taken to obtain intermediate results. Below, both possibilites are given:

# 4a: intermediate steps
ddsHTSeq_size_factor = estimateSizeFactors(ddsHTSeq)
sizeFactors(ddsHTSeq_size_factor)
ddsHTSeq_dispersion = estimateDispersions(ddsHTSeq_size_factor)
ddsHTSeq_GLM = nbinomWaldTest(ddsHTSeq_dispersion)
stepwise_results = results(ddsHTSeq_GLM, name="condition_siMEF24_vs_siCTR24")

# 4b: run in wrapper-function
ddsHTSeq = DESeq(ddsHTSeq)
res = results(ddsHTSeq, name="condition_siMEF24_vs_siCTR24")
resOrdered = res[order(res$pvalue),]
summary(res)
sum(res$padj<0.1, na.rm=TRUE)
```

5. post-processing of results from differential expression analysis
  - this includes a variance-stabilized transformation (vst) to normalize counts and allow improved plotting

Graphical display of different key parameters
  - the MA-plot shows those genes that have an expresisonal change and a significance-value above the threshold (shown in red).
  - plotCounts shows the expression of the two conditions for the gene with the lowest p-value (highest significance), which should be the factor targeted by the knowckdown: MEF2D.
  - principal component analysis shows the differences/ similarities between the replicates of the two conditions (note that PC1, explaining 70% of observed variance, separates the control and MEF2D-knockdown, while PC2, explaining 18% variance separates the different repliactes of each condition).
```{r}

# variance-stabilzed transformation
vsd = vst(ddsHTSeq)
head(assay(vsd), 3)
VSD = as.data.frame(assay(vsd))
VSD = rownames_to_column(VSD, var="ENSEMBL")

plotMA(res,
       ylim=c(-2,2),
       main="significantly changing genes")
plotCounts(ddsHTSeq,
           gene = which.min(res$padj),
           intgroup="condition")
plotPCA(vsd)

```

6. Transformation of data to perform subsequent analysis, like integration with ChIP-seq data, functional annotations and more plotting
```{r}
MEF2D_si24 = as.data.frame(res)
MEF2D_si24 = rownames_to_column(MEF2D_si24, var="ENSEMBL")
counts = as.data.frame(counts(ddsHTSeq, normalized=T))
counts = rownames_to_column(counts, var="ENSEMBL")
Norm_MEF2D_si24 = left_join(MEF2D_si24, counts)
symbols = mapIds(org.Hs.eg.db,
                 keys=Norm_MEF2D_si24$ENSEMBL,
                 keytype="ENSEMBL",
                 column="SYMBOL")
symbols = as.data.frame(symbols)
MEF2D_si24_Norm_Symbol = bind_cols(symbols, Norm_MEF2D_si24)
```

7. Use ChIP-seq data for the identification of direct target genes:
  - analyze the distribution of binding sites across the human genome
```{r}
txdb = TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg38.knownGene
promoter = getPromoters(TxDb=txdb,
                        upstream=3000, downstream=3000)

mef2d_Anno = annotatePeak(mef2d,
                          tssRegion=c(-3000, 3000),
                          TxDb=txdb, annoDb="org.Hs.eg.db")
plotAnnoBar(mef2d_Anno)

tagMatrix = getTagMatrix(mef2d, windows=promoter)
tagHeatmap(tagMatrix ,
           xlim=c(-3000,3000), color="red")
plotAvgProf(tagMatrix,
            xlim=c(-3000, 3000),
            xlab="Genomic Region (5'->3')", ylab="Read Count Frequency") +
            ggtitle("Factor binding signal at start site of genes")

```


8. identification of genes with binding-sites in their vicinity
```{r}

mef2d_gene = seq2gene(mef2d,
                      tssRegion=c(-1000, 1000),
                      flankDistance=3000, TxDb=txdb)
pathway2 = enrichPathway(mef2d_gene)
dotplot(pathway2, title="pathway enrichment of MEF2D target genes")


MEF2D_anno = as.data.frame(mef2d_Anno)
MEF2D_peaks = MEF2D_anno[,c(1:7,13,21:23)]
colnames(MEF2D_peaks) = c("chr","start", "end",
                          "peak_width", "strand",
                          "peakID", "peak_score",
                          "annotation", "distanceToTSS",
                          "ENSEMBL", "SYMBOL")
MEF2D_targets = MEF2D_peaks%>%left_join(Norm_MEF2D_si24)

#gene<-bitr(MEF2D_targets$ENSEMBL, fromType="ENSEMBL", toType="ENTREZID", OrgDb="org.Hs.eg.db")
p = enrichGO(gene=MEF2D_targets$ENSEMBL,
             OrgDb="org.Hs.eg.db",
             keyType="ENSEMBL", ont="MF",
             pvalueCutoff=0.05,
             pAdjustMethod="BH")

dotplot(p, title="OCI-AML-3 MEF2D")
```


9. visualization of differentially regulated genes
```{r}

subset_targets = subset(MEF2D_targets, MEF2D_targets$log2FoldChange>0.5 &
                          MEF2D_targets$padj<0.1 |
                          MEF2D_targets$log2FoldChange< -0.5 &
                          MEF2D_targets$padj<0.1)

subset_targets = subset_targets[!duplicated(subset_targets["ENSEMBL"]),]



library(gplots)

heatAll = subset_targets[,c(18:23)]
colnames(heatAll) = c("siCTR_1", "siCTR_2",
                      "siCTR_3","siMEF2D_1",
                      "siMEF2D_2", "siMEF2D_3")
rownames(heatAll) = subset_targets[,11]

tab = as.matrix(heatAll, as.is=T, header=T, row.names=1)

RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(n=6,"Set1")
cols   = colorpanel(15,"#2c7bb6","grey96","#d7191c")


heatmap.2(tab,col=cols, margins=c(10,5),
          scale="row", dendrogram="col",
          Colv=T, Rowv=T,
          key=TRUE, main="expression of MEF2D target genes",
          density.info="none", trace="none",
          cexRow=0.5, cexCol=0.8)
dev.off()
```

10. rawdata for example target genes (as raw-data is not deposited so far, this currently does not work)
```{r}
