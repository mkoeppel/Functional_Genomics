# Functional_Genomics
Finding real and direct target genes for a transcription factor is a challenging task in molecular biology. \
This R-script script is an example of an analytical pipeline from high-throughput sequencing (NGS) in functional genomics. 
It was created when I was teaching bioinformatics at the University of Applied Sciences in Bremen (HSB) in 2020.

The data used was generated in my lab at the DSMZ-Leibniz-Institut and, so far, is unpublished. Therefore, the raw-data has not yet been deposited to any nucleic acid archive. Provided is a form of pre-processed data, which is small enough to be distributed with the repo. All preprocessing steps are documented below and are standard first level analysis of NGS-data, that is quality-control and mapping/ counting to a reference genome.
